# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

`pgschema` is a CLI tool that brings Terraform-style declarative schema migration workflow to PostgreSQL. It provides a dump/edit/plan/apply workflow for database schema changes:

- **Dump**: Extract current schema in a developer-friendly format with support for all common objects
- **Edit**: Modify schema files to represent desired state
- **Plan**: Compare desired state with current database and generate migration plan
- **Apply**: Execute the migration with safety features like concurrent change detection, transaction-adaptive execution, and lock timeout control

The tool is written in Go 1.24+ (toolchain go1.24.7) and uses:

- Cobra for CLI commands
- embedded-postgres v1.29.0 for plan command (temporary instances) and testing (no Docker required)
- pgx/v5 v5.7.5 for database connections
- Supports PostgreSQL versions 14-17

Key differentiators:

- Comprehensive Postgres support for virtually all schema-level objects
- State-based Terraform-like workflow (no migration history table)
- Schema-level focus for single-schema apps to multi-tenant architectures
- No shadow database required - works directly with schema files and target database

## Skills

This project includes specialized skills for development workflows. Use these skills when working on pgschema:

- **pg_dump Reference** - Consult PostgreSQL's pg_dump implementation for system catalog queries and schema extraction patterns
- **PostgreSQL Syntax Reference** - Understand PostgreSQL's parser and grammar (gram.y) for SQL syntax and DDL structure
- **Validate with Database** - Connect to live PostgreSQL to validate assumptions, compare pg_dump vs pgschema, and query system catalogs
- **Run Tests** - Execute automated Go tests to validate diff logic, plan generation, and dump functionality

Skills are located in `.claude/skills/` and provide detailed workflows for common development tasks.

## Quick Start Commands

### Build

```bash
# Standard build
go build -o pgschema .

# Build with version info (used in CI/Docker)
go build -ldflags="-w -s -X github.com/pgschema/pgschema/cmd.GitCommit=... -X 'github.com/pgschema/pgschema/cmd.BuildDate=...'" -o pgschema .
```

### Testing

For detailed testing workflows, see the **Run Tests** skill (`.claude/skills/run_tests/SKILL.md`).

```bash
# Quick validation - diff tests only (fast, no database)
PGSCHEMA_TEST_FILTER="create_trigger/" go test -v ./internal/diff -run TestDiffFromFiles

## Architecture

### Core Components

**CLI Commands** (`cmd/`):

- `dump/` - Schema extraction from live database
- `plan/` - Migration planning by comparing schemas
- `apply/` - Migration execution with safety checks
- `util/` - Shared utilities (connection, env, ignore file processing)
- `root.go` - Main CLI setup with Cobra

**Core Packages**:

- `ir/` - Intermediate Representation (IR) package
  - Schema objects (tables, indexes, functions, procedures, triggers, policies, etc.)
  - Database inspector using pgx (queries pg_catalog for schema extraction)
  - Schema normalizer
  - Identifier quoting utilities
  - Note: Parser removed in favor of embedded-postgres approach

**Internal Packages** (`internal/`):

- `diff/` - Schema comparison and migration DDL generation
- `plan/` - Migration plan structures and execution
- `dump/` - Schema dump formatting and output
- `fingerprint/` - Schema fingerprinting for change detection
- `include/` - Include file processing for modular schemas
- `postgres/` - Database provider implementations (embedded and external)
  - `desired_state.go` - DesiredStateProvider interface
  - `embedded.go` - Embedded PostgreSQL implementation
  - `external.go` - External database implementation
- `color/` - Terminal output colorization
- `logger/` - Structured logging
- `version/` - Version information

### Key Architecture Patterns

**Schema Representation**: Uses an Intermediate Representation (IR) to normalize schema objects from database introspection. Both desired state (from user SQL files) and current state (from target database) are extracted by inspecting PostgreSQL databases.

**Embedded Postgres for Desired State**: The `plan` command spins up a temporary embedded PostgreSQL instance (by default) or connects to an external database (if `--plan-host` is provided), applies the user's SQL files to it, then inspects that database to get the desired state IR. This ensures both desired and current states come from the same source (database inspection), eliminating parser/inspector format differences. External database support is useful for environments where embedded postgres has limitations (e.g., ARM architectures, containerized environments).

**Migration Planning**: The `diff` package compares IR representations to generate a sequence of migration steps with proper dependency ordering (topological sort).

**Database Integration**: Uses `pgx/v5` for database connections and `embedded-postgres` (v1.29.0) for both the plan command (temporary instances) and integration testing (no Docker required).

**Inspector-Only Approach**: Both desired state (from user SQL files) and current state (from target database) are obtained through database inspection. The plan command spins up an embedded PostgreSQL instance, applies user SQL files, then inspects it to get the desired state IR. This eliminates the need for SQL parsing and ensures consistency.

**External Database for Plan Generation**: As an alternative to embedded postgres, users can provide an external PostgreSQL database using `--plan-host` flags or `PGSCHEMA_PLAN_*` environment variables. The external database approach:

- Creates temporary schemas with timestamp suffixes (e.g., `pgschema_tmp_20251030_154501_123456789`)
- Validates major version compatibility with target database (exact match required)
- Cleans up temporary schemas after use (best effort)
- Useful for environments where embedded postgres has limitations (ARM architectures, containerized environments)

## Common Development Workflows

### Adding New Schema Object Support

1. Add IR representation in `ir/ir.go`
2. Add database introspection logic in `ir/inspector.go` (consult **pg_dump Reference** skill for system catalog queries)
3. Add diff logic in `internal/diff/`
4. Add test cases in `testdata/diff/create_[object_type]/` (see **Run Tests** skill)
5. Validate with live database (see **Validate with Database** skill)

Note: Parser logic is no longer needed - both desired and current states come from database inspection.

### Debugging Schema Extraction

1. Consult **pg_dump Reference** skill to understand correct system catalog queries
2. Use **Validate with Database** skill to test queries against live PostgreSQL
3. Compare pg_dump output with pgschema output using workflows in **Validate with Database** skill

### Testing Changes

1. Use **Run Tests** skill for comprehensive testing workflows
2. Start with fast diff tests: `PGSCHEMA_TEST_FILTER="..." go test -v ./internal/diff -run TestDiffFromFiles`
3. Run integration tests: `PGSCHEMA_TEST_FILTER="..." go test -v ./cmd -run TestPlanAndApply`
4. Validate with live database using **Validate with Database** skill

## Supported Schema Objects

The tool supports comprehensive PostgreSQL schema objects (see `ir/ir.go` for complete data structures):

- **Tables**: Columns, identity columns, generated columns, partitioning, LIKE clauses
- **Constraints**: Primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints, check constraints, NOT VALID
- **Indexes**: Regular, unique, partial, functional/expression indexes, concurrent creation
- **Views**: Regular views and materialized views with indexes
- **Functions**: Parameters, return types, volatility, STRICT, SECURITY DEFINER
- **Procedures**: Parameters, signatures, language
- **Triggers**: Timing, events, levels, WHEN conditions, constraint triggers, REFERENCING OLD/NEW TABLE
- **Sequences**: Start, increment, min/max, cycle, cache, owned by tracking
- **Types**: Enum, composite, domain types with constraints
- **Policies**: Row-level security with commands, roles, USING/WITH CHECK expressions
- **Aggregates**: Custom aggregates with transition and final functions
- **Comments**: On all supported object types

## Environment Variables

- **Target database connection**: `PGHOST`, `PGPORT`, `PGUSER`, `PGPASSWORD`, `PGDATABASE`
- **Plan database connection** (optional - for external database instead of embedded postgres):
  - `PGSCHEMA_PLAN_HOST` - If set, uses external database for plan generation
  - `PGSCHEMA_PLAN_PORT` - Plan database port (default: 5432)
  - `PGSCHEMA_PLAN_DB` - Plan database name (required if PGSCHEMA_PLAN_HOST is set)
  - `PGSCHEMA_PLAN_USER` - Plan database user (required if PGSCHEMA_PLAN_HOST is set)
  - `PGSCHEMA_PLAN_PASSWORD` - Plan database password
- **Environment files**: `.env` - automatically loaded by main.go
- **Test filtering**: `PGSCHEMA_TEST_FILTER` - run specific test cases (e.g., `"create_table/"` or `"create_table/add_column"`)
- **Postgres version**: `PGSCHEMA_POSTGRES_VERSION` - test against specific versions (14, 15, 16, 17)

## Important Implementation Notes

**Trigger Features**:

- Full support for WHEN conditions using `pg_get_expr(t.tgqual, t.tgrelid, false)` from `pg_catalog.pg_trigger`
- Constraint triggers with deferrable options
- REFERENCING OLD TABLE / NEW TABLE for statement-level triggers

**Online Migration Support**:

- CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY for non-blocking index creation
- ALTER TABLE ... ADD CONSTRAINT ... NOT VALID for online constraint addition
- Proper transaction handling - some operations must run outside transactions

**pgschema Directives**:

- Special SQL comments control behavior: `--pgschema-lock-timeout`, `--pgschema-no-transaction`
- Handled in `cmd/apply/directive.go`

**Reference Implementations**:

- PostgreSQL's pg_dump serves as reference for system catalog queries (see **pg_dump Reference** skill)
- PostgreSQL's gram.y defines canonical SQL syntax (see **PostgreSQL Syntax Reference** skill)
