title: "CREATE VIEW"
---

## Syntax

```sql
create_view ::= CREATE [ OR REPLACE ] VIEW [ IF NOT EXISTS ] view_name 
                AS select_statement

view_name ::= [schema.]name

select_statement ::= SELECT ...
```

pgschema understands the following `CREATE VIEW` features:

- **Schema-qualified names**: Views can be defined in specific schemas
- **OR REPLACE**: Optional clause to replace an existing view definition
- **AS clause**: Any valid SELECT statement that defines the view's contents
- **View dependencies**: Proper handling of view-to-view dependencies

## Canonical Format

When generating migration SQL, pgschema produces views in the following canonical format:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW [schema.]view_name AS
select_statement;
```

**Key characteristics of the canonical format:**

- Always uses `CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW` for creation and modifications
- Schema qualification included when necessary
- Preserves the original SELECT statement formatting
- For DROP operations: `DROP VIEW IF EXISTS view_name CASCADE;`

**Note on modifications:** Regular views support `CREATE OR REPLACE`, allowing seamless updates to view definitions without dropping dependent objects. pgschema leverages this feature for efficient view migrations.
