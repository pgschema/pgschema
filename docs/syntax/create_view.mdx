## Basic Syntax

```sql
create_view ::= CREATE [OR REPLACE] VIEW [schema.]view_name AS select_statement

select_statement ::= SELECT [DISTINCT] select_list
                    FROM table_expression
                    [WHERE condition]
                    [GROUP BY expression [, ...]]
                    [HAVING condition]
                    [ORDER BY expression [ASC | DESC] [, ...]]
                    [LIMIT count]
```

## Basic Views

### Simple Views
```sql
-- Basic view with column selection
CREATE VIEW active_users AS 
SELECT id, name, email, created_at 
FROM users 
WHERE active = true;

-- View with column aliases
CREATE VIEW user_summary AS 
SELECT 
    id as user_id,
    name as full_name,
    email as email_address,
    created_at as registration_date
FROM users;
```

### Filtered Views
```sql
-- View with WHERE clause
CREATE VIEW recent_orders AS 
SELECT order_id, customer_id, total_amount, order_date 
FROM orders 
WHERE order_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days';

-- View with complex conditions
CREATE VIEW premium_customers AS 
SELECT customer_id, name, total_spent 
FROM customer_stats 
WHERE total_spent > 1000 AND account_type = 'premium';
```

## Views with JOINs

### Inner JOINs
```sql
-- View with simple JOIN
CREATE VIEW customer_orders AS 
SELECT 
    c.customer_id,
    c.name as customer_name,
    o.order_id,
    o.order_date,
    o.total_amount
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;
```

### Complex Multi-Table JOINs
```sql
-- View with multiple JOINs
CREATE VIEW order_details AS 
SELECT 
    o.order_id,
    c.name as customer_name,
    p.product_name,
    oi.quantity,
    oi.unit_price,
    (oi.quantity * oi.unit_price) as line_total
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
JOIN order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
WHERE o.status = 'completed';
```

### LEFT JOINs
```sql
-- View with LEFT JOIN to include all records
CREATE VIEW customer_order_summary AS 
SELECT 
    c.customer_id,
    c.name,
    c.email,
    COALESCE(COUNT(o.order_id), 0) as order_count,
    COALESCE(SUM(o.total_amount), 0) as total_spent
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.name, c.email;
```

## Aggregate Views

### Basic Aggregations
```sql
-- View with COUNT and SUM
CREATE VIEW monthly_sales AS 
SELECT 
    DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date) as month,
    COUNT(*) as order_count,
    SUM(total_amount) as total_revenue
FROM orders 
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date)
ORDER BY month;
```

### GROUP BY with HAVING
```sql
-- View with HAVING clause
CREATE VIEW high_volume_customers AS 
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    COUNT(*) as order_count,
    SUM(total_amount) as total_spent
FROM orders 
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 10 AND SUM(total_amount) > 5000;
```

### String Aggregation
```sql
-- View with string concatenation
CREATE VIEW customer_product_list AS 
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    string_agg(DISTINCT product_name, ', ') as purchased_products
FROM orders o
JOIN order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

## Views with Subqueries

### Subquery in FROM Clause
```sql
-- View with subquery
CREATE VIEW top_customers AS 
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    customer_name,
    total_spent
FROM (
    SELECT 
        c.customer_id,
        c.name as customer_name,
        SUM(o.total_amount) as total_spent
    FROM customers c
    JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
    GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.name
) customer_totals
WHERE total_spent > 1000
ORDER BY total_spent DESC;
```

### Correlated Subqueries
```sql
-- View with correlated subquery
CREATE VIEW latest_order_per_customer AS 
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    order_id,
    order_date,
    total_amount
FROM orders o1
WHERE order_date = (
    SELECT MAX(order_date)
    FROM orders o2
    WHERE o2.customer_id = o1.customer_id
);
```

### EXISTS Subqueries
```sql
-- View with EXISTS clause
CREATE VIEW customers_with_large_orders AS 
SELECT customer_id, name, email
FROM customers c
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 
    FROM orders o 
    WHERE o.customer_id = c.customer_id 
    AND o.total_amount > 1000
);
```

## Window Functions

### ROW_NUMBER
```sql
-- View with ROW_NUMBER window function
CREATE VIEW ranked_orders_by_customer AS 
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    order_id,
    order_date,
    total_amount,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY order_date DESC) as order_rank
FROM orders;
```

### RANK and DENSE_RANK
```sql
-- View with ranking functions
CREATE VIEW customer_ranking AS 
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    name,
    total_spent,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY total_spent DESC) as spending_rank,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY total_spent DESC) as spending_dense_rank
FROM customer_totals;
```

### Moving Averages
```sql
-- View with moving average
CREATE VIEW sales_with_moving_avg AS 
SELECT 
    sale_date,
    daily_revenue,
    AVG(daily_revenue) OVER (
        ORDER BY sale_date 
        ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) as seven_day_avg
FROM daily_sales
ORDER BY sale_date;
```

## Conditional Logic

### CASE Statements
```sql
-- View with CASE expressions
CREATE VIEW customer_segments AS 
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    name,
    total_spent,
    CASE 
        WHEN total_spent >= 10000 THEN 'VIP'
        WHEN total_spent >= 5000 THEN 'Premium'
        WHEN total_spent >= 1000 THEN 'Regular'
        ELSE 'New'
    END as customer_segment
FROM customer_totals;
```

### Status Calculations
```sql
-- View with status logic
CREATE VIEW user_activity_status AS 
SELECT 
    user_id,
    name,
    last_login,
    CASE 
        WHEN last_login > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days' THEN 'Active'
        WHEN last_login > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days' THEN 'Inactive'
        ELSE 'Dormant'
    END as activity_status
FROM users;
```

## Date and Time Views

### Date Truncation
```sql
-- View with date truncation
CREATE VIEW weekly_sales AS 
SELECT 
    DATE_TRUNC('week', order_date) as week_start,
    COUNT(*) as order_count,
    SUM(total_amount) as weekly_revenue
FROM orders 
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('week', order_date)
ORDER BY week_start;
```

### Time-Based Filtering
```sql
-- View with time-based conditions
CREATE VIEW current_month_stats AS 
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    COUNT(*) as orders_this_month,
    SUM(total_amount) as spent_this_month
FROM orders 
WHERE order_date >= DATE_TRUNC('month', CURRENT_DATE)
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

## Complex Real-World Examples

### E-commerce Order Summary
```sql
-- Complex view from real-world e-commerce system
CREATE VIEW comprehensive_order_view AS 
SELECT 
    o.order_id,
    c.name as customer_name,
    c.email as customer_email,
    o.order_date,
    o.status,
    COUNT(oi.order_item_id) as item_count,
    SUM(oi.quantity * oi.unit_price) as order_total,
    string_agg(p.product_name, ', ') as products,
    CASE 
        WHEN o.status = 'completed' THEN 'Fulfilled'
        WHEN o.status = 'shipped' THEN 'In Transit'
        WHEN o.status = 'processing' THEN 'Being Prepared'
        ELSE 'Pending'
    END as order_status_display
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
JOIN order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY o.order_id, c.name, c.email, o.order_date, o.status
ORDER BY o.order_date DESC;
```

### Financial Reporting View
```sql
-- View for financial reporting
CREATE VIEW monthly_financial_summary AS 
SELECT 
    DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date) as month,
    COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) as unique_customers,
    COUNT(*) as total_orders,
    SUM(total_amount) as gross_revenue,
    AVG(total_amount) as avg_order_value,
    SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'completed' THEN total_amount ELSE 0 END) as completed_revenue,
    SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'refunded' THEN total_amount ELSE 0 END) as refunded_amount
FROM orders 
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date)
ORDER BY month;
```

## Cross-Schema Views

pgschema properly handles cross-schema view references:

```sql
-- View referencing tables from multiple schemas
CREATE VIEW app.user_permissions AS 
SELECT 
    u.user_id,
    u.username,
    p.permission_name,
    r.role_name
FROM auth.users u
JOIN auth.user_roles ur ON u.user_id = ur.user_id
JOIN auth.roles r ON ur.role_id = r.role_id
JOIN auth.role_permissions rp ON r.role_id = rp.role_id
JOIN auth.permissions p ON rp.permission_id = p.permission_id;
```

## View Dependencies

pgschema handles view dependencies automatically:

```sql
-- Base view
CREATE VIEW customer_totals AS 
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    SUM(total_amount) as total_spent
FROM orders 
GROUP BY customer_id;

-- Dependent view (will be created after customer_totals)
CREATE VIEW vip_customers AS 
SELECT customer_id, total_spent
FROM customer_totals
WHERE total_spent > 10000;
```

## Migration Examples

### Creating New View
```sql
-- Add new view to existing schema
CREATE VIEW monthly_customer_stats AS 
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date) as month,
    COUNT(*) as orders_in_month,
    SUM(total_amount) as spent_in_month
FROM orders 
GROUP BY customer_id, DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date);
```

### Modifying Existing View
```sql
-- Modify existing view (uses CREATE OR REPLACE)
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW active_users AS 
SELECT 
    id,
    name,
    email,
    created_at,
    last_login  -- Added new column
FROM users 
WHERE active = true AND deleted_at IS NULL;  -- Added additional condition
```

### View with Comments
```sql
-- View with descriptive comment
CREATE VIEW high_value_customers AS 
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    name,
    total_lifetime_value
FROM customer_analytics 
WHERE total_lifetime_value > 5000;

COMMENT ON VIEW high_value_customers IS 'Customers with lifetime value over $5000 for targeted marketing campaigns';
```
