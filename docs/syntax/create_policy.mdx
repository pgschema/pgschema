title: "CREATE POLICY"
---

## Basic Syntax

```sql
create_policy ::= CREATE POLICY policy_name ON [schema.]table_name
                  [FOR {ALL | SELECT | INSERT | UPDATE | DELETE}]
                  [TO {role_name [, ...] | PUBLIC}]
                  [USING (expression)]
                  [WITH CHECK (expression)]

alter_table_rls ::= ALTER TABLE [schema.]table_name ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY
                  | ALTER TABLE [schema.]table_name DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY
```

## Row Level Security Basics

### Enable RLS on Table
```sql
-- Enable RLS on table
ALTER TABLE users ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create basic isolation policy
CREATE POLICY user_isolation ON users
    FOR ALL
    TO PUBLIC
    USING (user_id = current_user_id());
```

### Disable RLS
```sql
-- Disable RLS on table
ALTER TABLE users DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Drop existing policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS user_isolation ON users;
```

## Policy Commands

### SELECT Policies
```sql
-- Allow users to see only their own records
CREATE POLICY user_select_own ON users
    FOR SELECT
    TO user_role
    USING (user_id = current_user_id());

-- Allow admins to see all records
CREATE POLICY admin_select_all ON users
    FOR SELECT
    TO admin_role
    USING (true);
```

### INSERT Policies
```sql
-- Allow users to insert their own records
CREATE POLICY user_insert_own ON posts
    FOR INSERT
    TO user_role
    WITH CHECK (author_id = current_user_id());

-- Prevent users from inserting admin records
CREATE POLICY prevent_admin_insert ON users
    FOR INSERT
    TO user_role
    WITH CHECK (role != 'admin');
```

### UPDATE Policies
```sql
-- Allow users to update their own records
CREATE POLICY user_update_own ON profiles
    FOR UPDATE
    TO user_role
    USING (user_id = current_user_id())
    WITH CHECK (user_id = current_user_id());

-- Allow users to update non-sensitive fields only
CREATE POLICY user_update_profile ON users
    FOR UPDATE
    TO user_role
    USING (user_id = current_user_id())
    WITH CHECK (role = OLD.role AND admin_notes = OLD.admin_notes);
```

### DELETE Policies
```sql
-- Allow users to delete their own records
CREATE POLICY user_delete_own ON comments
    FOR DELETE
    TO user_role
    USING (author_id = current_user_id());

-- Prevent deletion of published content
CREATE POLICY prevent_delete_published ON articles
    FOR DELETE
    TO user_role
    USING (status != 'published');
```

### ALL Policies
```sql
-- General isolation policy for all operations
CREATE POLICY tenant_isolation ON orders
    FOR ALL
    TO app_user
    USING (tenant_id = current_setting('app.current_tenant')::INTEGER);
```

## Role-Based Policies

### Single Role Policies
```sql
-- Policy for specific role
CREATE POLICY admin_access ON sensitive_data
    FOR ALL
    TO admin_role
    USING (true);

-- Policy for regular users
CREATE POLICY user_limited_access ON sensitive_data
    FOR SELECT
    TO user_role
    USING (public_data = true);
```

### Multiple Role Policies
```sql
-- Policy for multiple roles
CREATE POLICY manager_supervisor_access ON employee_data
    FOR ALL
    TO manager_role, supervisor_role, hr_role
    USING (department_id = current_user_department());
```

### PUBLIC Role Policies
```sql
-- Policy for all users (default)
CREATE POLICY public_read_access ON public_articles
    FOR SELECT
    TO PUBLIC
    USING (published = true);
```

## Multi-Tenant Applications

### Tenant Isolation
```sql
-- Enable RLS on tenant tables
ALTER TABLE users ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE orders ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE products ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Tenant isolation policies
CREATE POLICY tenant_users ON users
    FOR ALL
    TO app_user
    USING (tenant_id = current_setting('app.current_tenant')::INTEGER);

CREATE POLICY tenant_orders ON orders
    FOR ALL
    TO app_user
    USING (tenant_id = current_setting('app.current_tenant')::INTEGER);

CREATE POLICY tenant_products ON products
    FOR ALL
    TO app_user
    USING (tenant_id = current_setting('app.current_tenant')::INTEGER);
```

### Tenant Admin Access
```sql
-- Allow tenant admins to access all data in their tenant
CREATE POLICY tenant_admin_access ON users
    FOR ALL
    TO tenant_admin
    USING (tenant_id = current_setting('app.current_tenant')::INTEGER);

-- Allow super admins to access all data
CREATE POLICY super_admin_access ON users
    FOR ALL
    TO super_admin
    USING (true);
```

## Complex Policy Expressions

### Date-Based Policies
```sql
-- Allow access to current records only
CREATE POLICY current_records_only ON subscriptions
    FOR SELECT
    TO user_role
    USING (
        start_date <= CURRENT_DATE 
        AND end_date >= CURRENT_DATE
        AND user_id = current_user_id()
    );
```

### Status-Based Policies
```sql
-- Allow access based on record status
CREATE POLICY active_records_only ON user_accounts
    FOR ALL
    TO user_role
    USING (
        status = 'active' 
        AND user_id = current_user_id()
        AND deleted_at IS NULL
    );
```

### JSON-Based Policies
```sql
-- Policy using JSON fields
CREATE POLICY permission_based_access ON documents
    FOR SELECT
    TO user_role
    USING (
        permissions->>'owner' = current_user 
        OR permissions->'readers' ? current_user
    );
```

### Function-Based Policies
```sql
-- Policy using custom functions
CREATE POLICY department_access ON employee_records
    FOR ALL
    TO employee_role
    USING (department_id = get_user_department(current_user));

-- Policy with complex business logic
CREATE POLICY project_access ON project_data
    FOR ALL
    TO project_user
    USING (
        project_id IN (
            SELECT project_id 
            FROM project_members 
            WHERE user_id = current_user_id()
        )
    );
```

## Audit and Logging Policies

### Audit Trail Access
```sql
-- Allow users to see their own audit records
CREATE POLICY user_audit_access ON audit_log
    FOR SELECT
    TO user_role
    USING (
        user_id = current_user_id() 
        OR user_name = current_user
    );

-- Allow admins to see all audit records
CREATE POLICY admin_audit_access ON audit_log
    FOR SELECT
    TO admin_role
    USING (true);
```

### System Logging
```sql
-- Allow system to insert audit records
CREATE POLICY system_audit_insert ON audit_log
    FOR INSERT
    TO system_user
    WITH CHECK (true);

-- Prevent users from modifying audit records
CREATE POLICY prevent_audit_changes ON audit_log
    FOR UPDATE
    TO PUBLIC
    USING (false);
```

## Hierarchical Access Control

### Manager-Employee Hierarchy
```sql
-- Employees can see their own records
CREATE POLICY employee_self_access ON employee_performance
    FOR SELECT
    TO employee_role
    USING (employee_id = current_user_id());

-- Managers can see their team's records
CREATE POLICY manager_team_access ON employee_performance
    FOR SELECT
    TO manager_role
    USING (
        manager_id = current_user_id()
        OR employee_id = current_user_id()
    );
```

### Department-Based Access
```sql
-- Department-level access control
CREATE POLICY department_access ON department_budget
    FOR ALL
    TO department_user
    USING (
        department_id = current_user_department()
        OR user_has_department_access(current_user_id(), department_id)
    );
```

## Time-Based Policies

### Business Hours Access
```sql
-- Allow access only during business hours
CREATE POLICY business_hours_access ON sensitive_operations
    FOR ALL
    TO business_user
    USING (
        EXTRACT(hour FROM NOW()) BETWEEN 9 AND 17
        AND EXTRACT(dow FROM NOW()) BETWEEN 1 AND 5
        AND user_id = current_user_id()
    );
```

### Retention-Based Access
```sql
-- Hide old records from regular users
CREATE POLICY recent_data_access ON transaction_history
    FOR SELECT
    TO user_role
    USING (
        created_at >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 year'
        AND user_id = current_user_id()
    );
```

## Schema-Qualified Policies

pgschema properly handles cross-schema policies:

```sql
-- Policy on table in specific schema
CREATE POLICY tenant_isolation ON tenant_data.users
    FOR ALL
    TO app_user
    USING (tenant_id = current_setting('app.current_tenant')::INTEGER);

-- Policy referencing cross-schema functions
CREATE POLICY user_permissions ON app.documents
    FOR SELECT
    TO app_user
    USING (auth.user_has_permission(current_user_id(), 'read_documents'));
```

## Policy Management

### Policy Modifications
```sql
-- Modify policy roles
ALTER POLICY user_access ON users TO user_role, premium_user;

-- Modify policy expressions
ALTER POLICY user_access ON users USING (
    user_id = current_user_id() 
    AND active = true
);
```

### Policy Removal
```sql
-- Remove specific policy
DROP POLICY user_isolation ON users;

-- Remove all policies when disabling RLS
ALTER TABLE users DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

## Real-World Examples

### E-commerce Platform
```sql
-- Customer data isolation
ALTER TABLE customers ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY customer_self_access ON customers
    FOR ALL
    TO customer_role
    USING (customer_id = current_user_id());

-- Order access control
ALTER TABLE orders ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY customer_orders ON orders
    FOR ALL
    TO customer_role
    USING (customer_id = current_user_id());

-- Support staff access
CREATE POLICY support_customer_access ON customers
    FOR SELECT
    TO support_role
    USING (
        customer_id IN (
            SELECT customer_id 
            FROM support_assignments 
            WHERE support_user_id = current_user_id()
        )
    );
```

### Healthcare System
```sql
-- Patient data access
ALTER TABLE patient_records ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Patients can see their own records
CREATE POLICY patient_self_access ON patient_records
    FOR SELECT
    TO patient_role
    USING (patient_id = current_user_id());

-- Healthcare providers can see assigned patients
CREATE POLICY provider_patient_access ON patient_records
    FOR ALL
    TO healthcare_provider
    USING (
        patient_id IN (
            SELECT patient_id 
            FROM patient_assignments 
            WHERE provider_id = current_user_id()
        )
    );
```

### Financial Services
```sql
-- Account access control
ALTER TABLE bank_accounts ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY account_owner_access ON bank_accounts
    FOR ALL
    TO account_holder
    USING (
        owner_id = current_user_id()
        OR account_id IN (
            SELECT account_id 
            FROM account_permissions 
            WHERE user_id = current_user_id()
        )
    );
```

## Limitations

- **Policy Comments**: Comments on policies are not currently supported
- **Restrictive Policies**: RESTRICTIVE policy type has limited testing
