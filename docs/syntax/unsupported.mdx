title: "Unsupported"
---

`pgschema` operates at the schema level. This means it does not support SQL commands that operate the non-schema level objects.

## Cluster Level Commands

- `CREATE DATABASE`
- `CREATE ROLE`
- `CREATE TABLESPACE`
- `CREATE USER`

## Database Level Commands

- `CREATE CAST`
- `CREATE COLLATION`
- `CREATE CONVERSION`
- `CREATE EVENT TRIGGER`
- `CREATE EXTENSION`
- `CREATE FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER`
- `CREATE LANGUAGE`
- `CREATE OPERATOR`
- `CREATE PUBLICATION`
- `CREATE SCHEMA`
- `CREATE SERVER`
- `CREATE SUBSCRIPTION`
- `CREATE TEXT SEARCH`
- `CREATE USER MAPPING`

## Schema Level Commands

We plan to support most schema-level commands in the future. Please check other sections for the schema-level database objects that we support right now.

## Rename

`RENAME` is not supported.
