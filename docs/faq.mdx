## Compatibility

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Which PostgreSQL versions are supported?">
    pgschema is tested with PostgreSQL versions 14, 15, 16, and 17. While it may work with older versions, we recommend using one of these tested versions for the best experience.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does pgschema work with PostgreSQL extensions?">
    Yes, pgschema supports PostgreSQL extensions. You can include `CREATE EXTENSION` statements in your schema files, and pgschema will handle them appropriately.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use pgschema with cloud PostgreSQL services?">
    Yes, pgschema works with any PostgreSQL-compatible database that you can connect to, including:
    - Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL
    - Google Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL
    - Azure Database for PostgreSQL
    - Supabase
    - Neon
    - And other PostgreSQL-compatible services
  </Accordion>

## Usage Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I handle database-specific settings?">
    pgschema focuses on schema structure (tables, indexes, functions, etc.) and doesn't manage:
    - Database-level settings
    - User/role management
    - Tablespace configuration
    
    These should be managed separately through your infrastructure tooling.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if a migration fails?">
    If a migration fails:
    1. pgschema will roll back the entire transaction
    2. Your database will remain in its previous state
    3. You'll see a clear error message indicating what went wrong
    4. Fix the issue in your schema file and try again
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why does pgschema show no changes when I expect some?">
    Common causes:
    - You're comparing against the wrong schema (check `--schema` flag)
    - The changes are in objects pgschema doesn't track yet
    - There's a syntax error in your SQL file
    - The database already matches your desired state
    
    Run with `--debug` flag for more detailed output.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I debug connection issues?">
    For connection problems:
    1. Verify PostgreSQL is running: `pg_isready -h host -p port`
    2. Check your credentials and permissions
    3. Ensure the database exists
    4. Check network/firewall settings
    5. Try connecting with `psql` using the same parameters
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What permissions does pgschema need?">
    pgschema needs:
    - `CONNECT` privilege on the database
    - `USAGE` privilege on the target schema
    - `CREATE` privilege on the schema (for new objects)
    - Appropriate privileges for all object types you're managing
    
    For read-only operations (dump, plan), only `SELECT` privileges are needed.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Advanced Topics

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How does pgschema handle dependencies?">
    pgschema automatically:
    - Detects dependencies between database objects
    - Orders DDL statements to respect dependencies
    - Creates objects in the correct order
    - Drops objects in reverse dependency order
    
    This ensures migrations always execute successfully.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use pgschema for database comparisons?">
    Yes! You can compare schemas across databases:
    ```bash
    # Dump both schemas
    pgschema dump --host db1 --db myapp > schema1.sql
    pgschema dump --host db2 --db myapp > schema2.sql
    
    # Compare with diff
    diff schema1.sql schema2.sql
    ```
