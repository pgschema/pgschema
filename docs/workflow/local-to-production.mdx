This workflow guides you through promoting schema changes across your environment pipeline. Start by
developing and testing migrations locally, then systematically deploy them through dev, UAT, and staging
environments before reaching production. Each environment serves as a validation checkpoint, ensuring
your schema changes are safe and reliable before they impact your production database.

```bash
# 1. Work on your feature in development
# Make database changes as needed...

# 2. Dump the development schema
pgschema dump --host dev.db.com --db myapp --user dev > schema.sql

# 3. Commit to version control
git add schema.sql
git commit -m "feat: add user profiles and audit logging"
git push origin feature/user-profiles

# 4. After code review and merge to main...
git checkout main
git pull

# 5. Preview changes against staging
pgschema plan --host staging.db.com --db myapp --user staging --file schema.sql

# 6. Apply to staging
pgschema apply --host staging.db.com --db myapp --user staging --file schema.sql

# 7. After testing, apply to production
pgschema plan --host prod.db.com --db myapp --user prod --file schema.sql
pgschema apply --host prod.db.com --db myapp --user prod --file schema.sql --auto-approve
```

<Note>
Steps 5-7 can be automated in your CI/CD pipeline. For example, you can configure GitHub Actions or GitLab CI to automatically apply schema changes to staging when merging to main, and to production after manual approval or successful staging tests.
