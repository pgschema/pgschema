## What is pgschema?

`pgschema` is a CLI tool that brings terraform-style declarative schema migration workflow to Postgres:

- **Dump** a Postgres schema in a developer-friendly format with support for all common objects
- **Edit** a schema to the desired state
- **Plan** a schema migration by comparing desired state with current database state
- **Apply** a schema migration with concurrent change detection, transaction-adaptive execution, and lock timeout control

Think of it as Terraform for your Postgres schemas - declare your desired state, generate plan, preview changes, and apply them with confidence.

## Why pgschema?

Traditional database migration tools often require you to write migrations manually or rely on ORMs that may not support all Postgres features. pgschema takes a different approach:

- **Declarative**: Define your desired schema state in SQL files
- **Schema-based**: Compare at the schema level instead of the database level to reconcile schemas across different tenants
- **Comprehensive**: Support most common Postgres objects under a schema
- **Transparent**: Show exactly what SQL will be executed before applying changes
