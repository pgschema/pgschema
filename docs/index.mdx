## What is pgschema?

`pgschema` is a CLI tool that brings terraform-like declarative schema migration workflow to Postgres:

- **Dump** Postgres schemas in a clean, developer-friendly format
- **Plan** migrations by comparing desired state with current database state
- **Apply** schema changes safely with dependency-aware ordering

Think of it as Terraform for your Postgres schemas - declare your desired state, preview changes, and apply them with confidence.

## Why pgschema?

Traditional database migration tools often require you to write migrations manually or rely on ORMs that may not support all Postgres features. pgschema takes a different approach:

- **Declarative**: Define your desired schema state in SQL files
- **Schema-based**: Reconciles schemas across different tenants
- **Comprehensive**: Supports all major Postgres objects
- **Transparent**: Shows exactly what SQL will be executed before applying changes

## Quick Example

```bash
# Dump current schema
pgschema dump --host localhost --db myapp --user postgres > schema.sql

# Edit schema file
echo "CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email);" >> schema.sql

# Plan changes to apply desired state
pgschema plan --host localhost --db myapp --user postgres --file schema.sql

# Apply changes with confirmation
pgschema apply --host localhost --db myapp --user postgres --file schema.sql
```
