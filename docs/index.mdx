`pgschema` is a CLI tool that brings terraform-like declarative schema migration workflow to Postgres.

## What is pgschema?

pgschema helps you:

- **Dump** PostgreSQL schemas in a clean, developer-friendly format
- **Plan** migrations by comparing desired state with current database state
- **Apply** schema changes safely with dependency-aware ordering

Think of it as Terraform for your PostgreSQL schemas - declare your desired state, preview changes, and apply them with confidence.

## Why pgschema?

Traditional database migration tools often require you to write migrations manually or rely on ORMs that may not support all PostgreSQL features. pgschema takes a different approach:

- **Declarative**: Define your desired schema state in SQL files
- **Comprehensive**: Supports all major PostgreSQL objects including functions, triggers, and custom types
- **Safe**: Analyzes dependencies and generates migrations in the correct order
- **Transparent**: Shows exactly what SQL will be executed before applying changes

## Quick Example

```bash
# Dump current schema
pgschema dump --host localhost --db myapp --user postgres > schema.sql

# Plan changes to apply desired state
pgschema plan --host localhost --db myapp --user postgres --file desired-schema.sql

# Apply changes with confirmation
pgschema apply --host localhost --db myapp --user postgres --file desired-schema.sql
```

## Supported PostgreSQL Versions

pgschema is tested with PostgreSQL versions 14, 15, 16, and 17.
